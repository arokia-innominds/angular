                <p>Test automation helps in reducing regression testing time and cutting down the time to market with significant cost savings on a long-term basis. However, a clear automation strategy and roadmap are key to ensuring the right return on investment on your automation initiatives. With disparate application architecture, multiple environments, third-party integrations, and multiple user devices, a standardized and consistent automation approach is needed to ensure high reusability, ease of maintenance and lower upfront costs.</p>

                <h6>Why choose test automation</h6>
                <p>Fast software release cycles are almost impossible to manage without test automation. Manual testing is too slow to keep up with agile software development. When it comes to verification, validation and integration of software, manual testing can be cumbersome and even prove impossible over time.</p>
                <p>On an average, testing consumes 30-40 percent of a company's IT development costs. It is also becoming increasingly clear that manual testing is not adequate to verify the functioning of complex ecosystems. This makes testing a major bottleneck in software development. It is no wonder than that test automation is becoming more important than ever.</p>
                <h6>Test automation as part of business strategy and product development</h6>
                <p>The success of any business depends on the smooth operation of information systems. Faulty or malfunctioning software can have an adverse impact on the lives of millions of people at once. Imagine what would happen if Google Maps were to display wrong routes for even half an hour! Although not everyone realizes it, test automation is a crucial part of business strategy and product development.</p>
                <p>Effective test automation can accelerate business and keep it competitive â€” new, tested products can be introduced to the market every week.</p>
                <p>If that sounds exciting to you, then you are in the right place! But first you need to think about what you want to achieve by harnessing the power of test automation.</p>
