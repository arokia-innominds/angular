                <p>Virtual Validation (CAE) is the use of computer software to simulate performance in order to improve product designs or assist in the resolution of engineering problems for a wide range of industries. This includes simulation, validation and optimization of products, processes, and manufacturing tools.</p>
                <p>Virtual Performance include, etc., weight, body stiffness, body frequencies, durability, and according to the Key Targets deployments prepared by Msaii</p>
                <p><strong>Static NVH:</strong> Body in white Stiffness and Modes, Vibration Iterance, FRF (Frequency Response Function), acoustics, etc.</p>
                <p><strong>Safety:</strong> sub-systems analysis, full structural crash, pedestrian impact.</p>
                <p><strong>Non linear and Durability:</strong> movable parts analysis, Body durability, welding resistance</p>

                <h6>Finite Element Analysis (FEA)</h6>
                <p>MSAII experience in Engineering Analysis is further demonstrated through our Finite Element Analysis (FEA) service that we provide. Being a crucial part of any product design phase or product examination, our Finite Element Analysis validates the design approach, materials being used and ultimately simulates the product in use.</p>
                <p>We make use 3D models, analysis software, and theoretical deductions to conduct Finite Element Analysis on your designs or products. Due to the high technical competence we have, we expose your product to various virtual operating conditions to observe how it behaves in both normal, stressed and regression scenarios. This provides you with robust designs and potential failure modes within your product.</p>
