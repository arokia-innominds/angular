                <p>We specializes in engineering complex, high-precision dies for medium-to- large parts in a wide variety of materials. Our Design and Engin3d_modeering team partners with customers from concept development through production to ensure the optimal engineering solution and highest level of satisfaction.</p>
                <p>At our company, our process begins with a partnership between our design and engineering team and the client. We continue to work with the customer every step of the way, from complete Simulation and Prototype to 3D Design and part production validation. With open communication, we obtain valuable feedback throughout our production process to ensure customized, precise tooling that meets all industry and customer standards while optimizing production processes.</p>
                <h1>Die Design</h1>
                <p>At MSAII, our Die Design services are backed by years of retained intellectual property and the latest technologies in order to assist clients with their custom die needs. Siemens NX software and CATIA, along with custom created user functions, allows our company to greatly reduce design lead time and ensure design accuracy. With experience in tooling all types of dies including blanking dies, transfer, progressive dies and line dies, our highly skilled designers and engineers can create processes for unique intricate tooling situations. Our Die Design services shorten lead times, maximize material utilization, eliminate waste, maximize production speeds, reduce maintenance and improve the overall quality of the part product and tooling.</p>
                <h1>3d Cad Modeling</h1>
                <p>Our 3D CAD Modeling utilizes both Siemens NX and CATIA software to create complex product surfaces supporting Simulation and Design processes. Hoofing can also ‘Reverse Engineer’ CAD model, detail components and part product geometry from data provided from our ATOS blue light scanner. Our company also provides product design services in CAD, typically a service addressing product feasibility issues during the Simulation process. This technology allows us to test and validate the complete design before we ever begin manufacturing the tool. Walker’s 3D CAD Modeling ensures the most efficient and total cost effective process of designing robust and production-ready metal stamping dies.</p>
                <h1>Die Simulation</h1>
                <p>Utilizing the very latest innovative technology and software, our engineers perform simulations for successful tooling designs and material selections. Our Die Simulation process ensures that the production material, product geometry and tool process will withstand the rigors of the production process. Some examples of problem areas commonly addressed during Die Simulation are thinning, fracturing, compression, stretch, wrinkling, trim line optimization, spring back and spring back compensation.</p>
                <p>Our Company serves a variety of industries with high precision tooling dies designed and constructed for maximum operational efficiency and minimum waste and maintenance. For more information on how we can help your business, please contact us.</p>
