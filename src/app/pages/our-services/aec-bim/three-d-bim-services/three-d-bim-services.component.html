                <p>BIM is an intelligent, digital model-based process that enables professionals involved in the design, engineering, construction and operation of built assets to design, engineer, construct and operate assets using powerful BIM software and recognized BIM processes. We have capability to provide LOD 500.  We are specialized in the field of MEP (particularly HVAC) and our BIM service is an integral part of our service suite, which includes electrical engineering services, plumbing engineering services,  Scan to BIM (CAD to Revit modeling) services, construction administration services, utility filing services and engineering  report services.
                  Our BIM team works closely our other engineering teams to assist in delivering MEP BIM services to meet the following core needs:
                </p>

    <h6>Structural</h6>
    <p>We provide your project with our expertise in design, optimization, and construction-process innovation. Our engineers are experienced in the design and analysis of all types of building uses: residential, commercial, hospitality, healthcare, industrial and institutional buildings. Our experience with common materials and systems such as concrete, steel, precast, post tensioned, wood and masonry gives us the ability to design the most optimum, cost efficient solution tailored to the project´s needs.</p>
    <p>Knowledge in advanced structural design and analysis provide the team with the tools to perform seismic and wind analysis on high-rise buildings, special deep foundation designs, post tensioned systems and detailed steel structure design. Expertise in the design of infrastructure and transportation buildings provides custom engineering to meet the sector´s needs.</p>
    <p>Our team works alongside architects and MEP engineers on all phases of the project, from conceptual to construction phase, providing a smooth and efficient transition from plan to completion. All of our design documents are developed using a BIM 3D model which allows us to anticipate conflicts and solve coordination problems before they manifest. Services include signed/sealed engineering drawings, calculations, and reports, along with shop drawing review and contractor RFI responses.</p>
