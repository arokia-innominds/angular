                <p>Scan to BIM is the process of using laser scanning to capture an accurate 3D scan of an existing asset. At MSAII we provide a Scan to BIM service to provide an accurate digital representation of an existing asset for use at every MEP project stage. Converting relevant point cloud and laser scan data containing 3D object surface measurement we can create intelligent data-rich 3D models that can be used for BIM modeling purposes by designers and engineers.</p>
                <p>The core benefit of our Scan to BIM service is the high degree of accuracy 3D models from laser scan information provides, accurate to the nearest millimeter. Accurate 3D models increase speed and reduce the likelihood of error.</p>
                <p>Our scan to BIM services provides you with an accurate digital representation of the building site that can be used for every possible stage of the project from planning to design, assessment and evaluation. We convert the relevant point cloud and laser scan data to make intelligent data-rich 3D models that BIM modelers can use for design purposes. Our scan to BIM modeling service is particularly useful for managing facilities in AEC projects and for checking the feasibility of expansion or extensions.</p>
                <h6>Advantage</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Point cloud to BIM Modeling guarantees more accuracy than manual survey</li>
                    <li>Less resource and time consumption for laser scanning</li>
                    <li>Ability to model directly from scans, thus implies more accuracy in terms of detailing captured</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We have developed Architectural, Structural and MEP models from point cloud images. Our scan to BIM conversion services ensures high level of accuracy and quick turnaround time. Tesla has over the period of time developed excellent expertise in deciphering the scans and converting them into data rich models and 2D cad drawings.</p>
                <p>We develop Parametric Revit Families, complex components and elements which are not visible in scans by referring to photos or CAD drawings too.</p>
                <p>We use all the scan formats available and compatible with BIM software. These scan formats should be registered with complete building</p>
